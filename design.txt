	 To-Do
===============
(Ranked in order of priority)

1. Research and implement height variance.
(For example, so city maps can be made)

2. Ability to switch between tile sets so
number tile identification is easier to
manage

3. Research and implement Perlin Noise and
other noise algorithms to randomly generate
terrian and show it isometrically.
(Something that looks like Transport Tycoon)
